# Bi1121c - Introduction to Research Software Engineering
## Instructions

In this exercise, we will be exploring and analysing the AmesHousing dataset using R. The dataset contains information about houses in Ames, Iowa, and includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and sale price.

During the course of the practical, we will move from analysing the dataset in an interactive session to creating a command line application that can be used to perform the analysis. The final application will be a command line tool that takes a CSV file as input and outputs the results of the analysis. The bonus is to extend the code to a software package that could be installed by other users.

The steps in each stage of the exercise are the pretty much the same, but each stage will cover some additional aspects of research software engineering.
The steps are:
1. Prepare the environment
2. Load the dataset
3. Clean the dataset
4. Data exploration
5. Create a plot
6. Test the hypothesis

The stages are:
1. Interactive session
2. RMarkdown document
3. Executable R script
4. R script with command line arguments
5. R package

### Stage 1 - Interactive Session

We start the analysis and data exploration in an interactive session.
Let's start with creating a new project in RStudio. To get access to the dataset we are going to work with,
